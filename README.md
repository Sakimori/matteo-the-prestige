# matteo-the-prestige
# simsim discord bot

blaseball, blaseball, is back! in an unofficial capacity. this project is completely unaffiliated with the game band.

we have custom players (generated by onomancer), custom teams, custom leagues (that last one is coming soon™), all set up in discord and watchable at https://simsim.sibr.dev! 

if you would like to add matteo to your server to be able to set up teams and games, you can do so with this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=789956166796574740&permissions=388160&scope=bot

## commands: (everything here is case sensitive, and can be prefixed with either m; or m!)
### team commands:
#### creation and deletion:
- m;saveteam
  - saves a team to the database allowing it to be used for games. use this command at the top of a list with entries separated by new lines:
	- the first line of the list is your team's name.
	- the second line is the team's icon and slogan, generally this is an emoji followed by a space, followed by a short slogan.
	- the third line must be blank.
	- the next lines are your batters' names in the order you want them to appear in your lineup, lineups can contain any number of batters between 1 and 12.
	- then another blank line seperating your batters and your pitchers.
	- the final lines are the names of the pitchers in your rotation, rotations can contain any number of pitchers between 1 and 8.
  - if you did it correctly, you'll get a team embed with a prompt to confirm. hit the 👍 and your team will be saved!
- m;deleteteam [teamname] \(requires team ownership)
  - allows you to delete the team with the provided name. you'll get an embed with a confirmation to prevent accidental deletions. hit the 👍 and your team will be deleted.
- m;import
  - imports an onomancer collection as a new team. you can use the new onomancer simsim setting to ensure compatibility. similarly to saveteam, you'll get a team embed with a prompt to confirm, hit the 👍 and your team will be saved!
#### editing (all of these commands require ownership and exact spelling of the team name):
- m;addplayer batter/pitcher [team name] \[player name]
  - adds a new player to the end of your team, either in the lineup or the rotation depending on which version you use. use addplayer batter or addplayer pitcher at the top of a list with entries separated by new lines:

	- the name of the player you want to add to the team.
- m;moveplayer [team name] \[player name] [new lineup/rotation position number]
  - moves a player within your lineup or rotation. if you want to instead move a player from your rotation to your lineup or vice versa, use m;swapsection instead. use this command at the top of a list with entries separated by new lines:
    - the name of the team you want to move the player on.
	- the name of the player you want to move.
	- the position you want to move them too, indexed with 1 being the first position of the lineup or rotation. all players below the specified position in the lineup or rotation will be pushed down.

	- the name of the player you want to remove.
#### viewing and searching:  
- m;showteam [name]
  - shows the lineup, rotation, and slogan of any saved team in a discord embed with primary stat star ratings for all of the players. this command has fuzzy search so you don't need to type the full name of the team as long as you give enough to identify the team you're looking for.

- m;startgame --day # or -d #
  - starts a game with premade teams made using saveteam. provides a link to the website where you can watch the game. 
  - the --day/-d is optional, if used it'll force the game to use the #th spot in each team's rotations. if this number is larger than the number of pitchers in one or both of the teams' rotations it'll wrap around. if it is not used pitchers will be chosen randomly from the teams' rotations.
  - use this command at the top of a list with entries separated by new lines:
	- the away team's name.

	- post this with all three of these things for all participants and the draft will begin.
