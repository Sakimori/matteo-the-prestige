## FAQ:
- Q: What is sim16?  
  A: This twitter thread provides outlines the basics pretty well, give it a read: https://twitter.com/FHelltiger/status/1374119998780755969?s=20

- Q: How do I get started with sim16?  
  A: If you aren't already in a discord server that has the bot, add it to your server with the link at the start. Once you've done that or if you're already in a server with it, start by making a team using m;saveteam, you can see a description of how to use this here in the readme or by using m;help saveteam. Once you have a team, I recommend looking into the OBL starting my doing m;oblhelp. Other than that, I recommend joining the main discord above and having a look at the #lfg channel there if you're interested in participating in a league, otherwise just look around the readme and do what sounds fun to you!

- Q: I'm trying to make a league on the website but when I click the 'submit' button it doesn't do anything and doesn't give an error message.  
  A: This is a known issue, to avoid it make sure you have an even number of divisions and subleagues and an equal number of teams in each division. These are all requirements for a league and sometimes if some of them aren't met the submit button will fail silently. If you're still having this issue after doing all of this correctly please submit a bug report via the form.

- Q: What is the maximum and minimum sizes for teams?  
  A: The minimum size is 1 batter and 1 pitcher, the maximum size is 20 batters and 8 pitchers.

- Q: What does [weather] do?  
  A: See the weathers section of the readme for a description of all the weathers except the current patch's weathers, those you have to figure out yourself (or just ask and someone will probably tell you).

- Q: My league stopped playing randomly and I don't know why, what should I do?  
  A: There were probably server issues or a patch went out, use the startleague command again and things should resume from where they left off, if this doesn't fix it submit an issue to the issue reporting form and we can troubleshoot it for you.  

- Q: Why aren't all the teams playing on every day of my league/why do teams have an uneven amount of games played in my league?  
  A: Scheduling algorithms are hard and due to how this one was coded, sometimes teams have bye weeks and rest for some games the season, this should all even out by the end of the season and each team will play the same number of games.

- Q: What should I do if my question isn't answered by this FAQ, this readme, or the help text for the commands, or I find a bug?  
  A: If you have any mechanical questions, feel free to stop by the sim16 discord linked at the beginning and ask your question in the lobby there. If you have an issue or think you've found a bug, submit it to the issue reporting form and we'll look into it.

  - The --day/-d is an optional flag, if used it'll force the game to use the #th spot in each team's rotations.

  - The --rounddelay is optional, if used, # must be between 1 and 120 and it'll set the delay between rounds to be # minutes. If not included it will default to 10.

  - The -d # flag sets the size of the draft pool, by default this is 20.
  - The -m # flag sets the minimum size the pool can reach before resetting, by default this is 5, this cannot be set to the same as -d but if set to one lower the pool will refresh after every pick.

## Archetypes
- All current archetypes are listed here with short descriptions and their short names, all archetypes can be assigned to pitchers or hitters but they all currently primarily affect one or the other so they will be noted as such here:

  - Contact Specialist/contact (batter): Better at getting hits at the cost of power.
  - Sprinter/speed (batter): Better at baserunning and defense at the cost of home run power.
  - They've Got the Stuff/velocity (pitcher): Better at getting outs at the cost of giving up more walks.
  - Puppetmaster/control (pitcher): Better at getting weak contact at the cost of allowing more hits.

## Weathers
- All current sim16 weathers are listed here with a short description of their effects except for the most recent weathers whose effects remain a mystery.
  - Supernova üåü: Makes all pitchers pitch worse, significantly increased effect on stronger pitchers.
  - Midnight üï∂: Significantly increased the chance that players will attempt to steal a base.
  - Blizzard ‚ùÑ: Occasionally causes the team's pitcher to bat in place of the scheduled batter.
  - Slight Tailwind üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄ: Occasionally batters get a mulligan and start the at bat over if they would have gotten out, significantly more likely to happen for weaker batters. 
  - Thinned Veil üåå: When a player hits a dinger, they end up on the base corresponding to the number of runs the dinger scored, 1st base if it's a solo home run, up to none base if it's a grand slam, resulting in 5 runs scoring.
  - Twilight üëª: Occasionally turns outs into hit by causing the ball to go ethereal, preventing the fielder from catching it.
  - Drizzle üåß: Causes each inning to start with the previous inning's final batter on second base.
  - Heat Wave üåÑ: Occasionally causes pitchers to be relieved by a random player from the lineup.
  - Breezy üéê: Occasionally swaps letters of a player's name, altering their name for the remainder of the game and changing their stats.
  - Starlight üåÉ: The stars are displeased with dingers and will cancel most of them out by pulling them foul.
  - Meteor Shower üå†: Has a chance to warp runners on base to none base causing them to score.
  - Hurricane üåÄ: Flips the scoreboard every few innings.
  - Tornado üå™: Occasionally shuffles baserunners around to different bases.
  - Torrential Downpour ‚õà: The game does not end until one team scores X runs where X is the original inning count of the game, 9 by default.
  - Summer Mist üåÅ: When a player hits into an out, they have a chance to get lost in the mist and be temporarily removed from the lineup. If another player gets lost in the mist the first player returns and takes the newly lost player's spot in the lineup.
  - Leaf Eddies üçÇ: The visiting team plays all of their outs in a row without inning breaks, then the home team does the same, if the game ends tied, each team plays sudden death 1-out 'golden run' innings until the game is decided.
  - Smog üöå: Picks a new random weather at the beginning of each inning from: Supernova, Midnight, Slight Tailwind, Twilight, Thinned Veil, Drizzle, Breezy, Starlight, Meteor Shower, Hurricane, Tornado, Summer Mist, and Dusk.
